The Diabetes Onset Prediction Project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques in Python. EDA is performed to identify patterns, correlations, and key factors such as age, glucose levels, and BMI that influence diabetes onset. The data is preprocessed, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding. Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are deployed to predict diabetes risk. This initiative empowers ABC Health to enhance patient outcomes, optimize healthcare resources, and proactively address diabetes, ensuring timely intervention and improved healthcare decisions.
